# SkimMed

SkimMed is an AI-powered application for parsing and analyzing **medical documents**.  
It extracts structured information from uploaded medical PDFs, splits them into manageable chunks, and allows users to query them in natural language using a Hugging Face-hosted LLM.

## Features
- **Upload PDF documents** for instant processing.
- **Smart text chunking** for better context handling.
- **Hugging Face model integration** for decision-making.
- Click-to-view reasoning (keeps the UI clean).
- Built with **Gradio** for a simple, interactive interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Gradio** – UI framework
- **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)** – PDF text extraction
- **Sentence Transformers** – text embeddings
- **Hugging Face Hub** – model hosting and inference
- **NumPy** – array operations
- **python-dotenv** – environment variable handling
